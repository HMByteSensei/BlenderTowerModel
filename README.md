## Overview
This project is a **3D tower model**, a historic fortress located in Lisbon, Portugal. The model was created in **Blender** with attention to architectural details.
It was used for my [EduAugmentedReality](https://github.com/HMByteSensei/EduAugmentedReality) app. Whole project was created as part of the Computer Graphics course.
